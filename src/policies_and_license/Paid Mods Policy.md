# Wabbajack Policy on Paid Mods

Paid mods are ineligible to be included in any Wabbajack list. "Paid mods" are considered to be any mod that has not been commissioned/contracted/created directly by the base game's studio or publisher. Your modlist **cannot require** any paid mod(s) to successfully install.

As an example, take Bethesda's Anniversary Edition Creation Club (AECC) items, and their new Verified Creations. The AECC items have been directly commissioned by Bethesda, whereas the Verified creations have only been approved by Bethesda for sale on their platform. You can find more information about this distinction on [this page](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_Mod:Verified_Creations) of the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Wiki.

If you wish to provide support to users who want to install paid mods on top of your Wabbajack modlist through additional patches and guides, you may, but with certain restrictions. These patches must NOT be included in your Wabbajack installer, but rather offered as a separate download and/or guide. In addition, your Wabbajack modlist cannot not be considered, advertised, or otherwise stated as "incomplete" without these additions.

Refer to the chart below for a basic understanding of what mods are and are not allowed in Wabbajack lists according to this policy, in the context of Skyrim Modding.
